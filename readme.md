# Test repository to learn python / git
The code solves a Poisson equation with bc's and right hand side prescribed through a simple user interface. 
Module simpack.py runs the program.
### Note 

* For now, only essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions are considered.
* **The FEM solver contains a bug.**
    * I will not spend time fixing it yet

### Todo 
1. Fix the bug
2. Add linear boundary conditions as well
3. Add Neumann boundary conditions
4. ...
