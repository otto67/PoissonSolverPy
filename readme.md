The code solves a poisson equation with bc's and right hand side prescribed through a simple user interface. 
### Note 
1.For now, only essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions are considered.
2. **Note that the FEM solver contains a bug.**
    * I will not spend time fixing it yet
### Todo 
1. Fix the bug
2. Add linear boundary conditions as well
3. Add Neumann boundary conditions
4. ...
